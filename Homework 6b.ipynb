    "Over the past few weeks, we've played with integrating ordinary differential equations with initial data and partial differential equations with boundary conditions. This problem combines the two techniques into the *forward-time centered-space* method for solving a partial differential equation with initial and boundary data.\n",

    "This sort of thing shows up when we have an equation with partial derivatives space *and* time. In my opinion, *most* of the insightful equations in physics are of this form: they tell you how each piece of your system evolves ($\\partial/\\partial t$) as a function of the neighboring pieces of the system ($\\partial/\\partial x$).\n",

    "In this problem (based on Newman Ex. 9.3) we consider the scenario of a steel container (1 cm thick) that is initially 20$^\\circ$ C. At $t=0$ it is then placed in a bath of cold water (0$^\\circ$ C) and simultaneously filled with hot water (50$^\\circ$ C). Assuming that the container is sufficiently wide that we can ignore edge effects, what is the temperature  $T(x,t)$ across the 1 cm of steel as a function of distance $x$ from the cold side and of time $t$?\n",
